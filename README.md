Cat Image Preprocessing Project

This project demonstrates five essential image preprocessing techniques applied on a dataset of cat images. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision and deep learning to improve image quality and enhance model performance.

Dataset:
I am using a folder which contains cat images that I captured from my mobile camera. Folder name is “cats” having 15 images for sample image preprocessing.

Preprocessing Techniques Used

The following five preprocessing techniques were applied:
Resize
Gaussian Blur
Salt & Pepper Noise
Laplacian Sharpening
Normalization

Each technique is applied separately and saved in its own folder.
A combined version applying all techniques in sequence is also generated.

Features:
Loads all cat images from a folder
Applies 5 preprocessing techniques individually
Saves processed images into separate output folders
Generates a combined preprocessed image using the full pipeline
Includes before/after comparison visualizations
